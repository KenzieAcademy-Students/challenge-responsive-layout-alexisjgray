# Kenzie Academy Challenge: Responsive Layout

Follow the instructions provided on `my.kenzie.academy` for this challenge. The `style1.css` and `style2.css` files and the `src` folder are placeholders. Feel free to rename it or add additional files to the project. You are allowed to change any of the files **except the HTML file**. If you would like to use some JavaScript, you are more than welcome to, but it isn't necessary.

Customize this README.md however you want to turn it into documentation for your project (including deleting these opening paragraphs). The only required sections are the **Project Plan** and **Reflection** below. Be sure to use proper Markdown syntax in this file (here's a [cheatsheet PDF](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) of the basic syntax).

## Project Plan (Advanced Level Only)

_(Put your project plan here. Explain the reasoning behind your design and your thought process from conception to implementation.)_

## Reflection (All Levels)

Why is it important that a website works well on a broad range of browsers and screen sizes?

As front-end developers, how do we make sure that pages work equally well across a variety of browsers and screen size?

_(Put your reflection answer here.)_

It is important for a website to work on a broad range of browsers and screen sizes because of readability and the users experience.
If the user is unable to navigate the website successfully then the business will lose profit.

Front-end developers use adaptive and responsive web design which works to detect the screen size and also retrofits an existing site in order to make it suitable other devices.

In order to ensure that the page works on a broad range of browsers a doctype has to be set, certain CSS rules need to be set
because each browser has it's own set of CSS rules, use cross-browser compatible libraries and frameworks, and finally test the site to make sure it works.
