# Kenzie Academy Challenge: Responsive Layout

Follow the instructions provided on `my.kenzie.academy` for this challenge. The `style1.css` and `style2.css` files and the `src` folder are placeholders. Feel free to rename it or add additional files to the project. You are allowed to change any of the files **except the HTML file**. If you would like to use some JavaScript, you are more than welcome to, but it isn't necessary.

Customize this README.md however you want to turn it into documentation for your project (including deleting these opening paragraphs). The only required sections are the **Project Plan** and **Reflection** below. Be sure to use proper Markdown syntax in this file (here's a [cheatsheet PDF](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) of the basic syntax).

## Project Plan (Advanced Level Only)

_(Put your project plan here. Explain the reasoning behind your design and your thought process from conception to implementation.)_

## Reflection (All Levels)

Why is it important that a website works well on a broad range of browsers and screen sizes?
 
As front-end developers, how do we make sure that pages work equally well across a variety of browsers and screen size?

_(Put your reflection answer here.)_
